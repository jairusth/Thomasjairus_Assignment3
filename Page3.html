	<h4>Yeah, this is definitely not basic, sorry about that. this is pretty much a summary of all three of the original games, not the new one. if you have already played the new one, don't spoil it for others.</h4>
	<h2>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</h2>
	<h4><p>In 2011, a civil war has broken out in Russia between its government and ultranationalists who seek to restore Russia to its Soviet-era glamor. Meanwhile, a separatist group led by Khaled Al-Asad seizes power in a "small but oil-rich" country in the Middle East through a coup d'Ã©tat, executing its president, Al-Fulani. Al-Asad is ruthless and has extreme anti-Western views, which prompts the United States to invade the country. In the afternoon of the second day of the invasion, a platoon of USMC 1st Force Recon, led by Lieutenant Vasquez, is sent to capture Al-Asad. The platoon attacks a TV station in which Al-Asad was believed to be broadcasting live, but discover only a looped recording. The group later engages in urban combat in an unnamed city south of the capital. During this time, they help support and subsequently repair a downed M1 Abrams tank to assist them.</p>

<p>In the meantime, John "Soap" MacTavish is recruited into a British Special Air Service (SAS) squad led by Captain Price. The group shortly conducts two operations, one which leads them to infiltrate a cargo ship in the Bering Strait. Neutralizing the armed Russians on board, the group discover a nuclear device labeled in Arabic and retrieve its manifest. Enemy MiGs then attack and scuttle the ship, but the SAS narrowly escapes by helicopter.</p>

<p>The second operation takes them to Russia in order to rescue one of their allies, a Russian informant named Nikolai working within the Ultranationalist party. Assisted by Russian loyalist forces, Price's team succeeds in rescuing Nikolai. However, their helicopter is later brought down, forcing the group to make their way through enemy territory with support from an AC-130 gunship before they can be extracted. Intelligence gathered from these two missions indicates that Al-Asad may be in possession of a Russian nuclear device.</p>

<p>In the evening of the third day, the U.S. launches a full-scale assault on Al-Asad's presidential palace, aware of the SAS warning about the possible nuclear device. As U.S. Navy SEALs invade the palace, the Marines engage Al-Asad's ground forces. The assault, however, ends in catastrophe when the nuclear device suddenly detonates, wiping out most of the city along with everyone in it.</p>

<p>Refusing to assume Al-Asad dead, Price's strike team supported by Russian loyalists raids a potential safe house in a village in Azerbaijan to eradicate the occupying Russian forces and capture Al-Asad. Shortly into the interrogation, Al-Asad's phone rings. After hearing the voice of the caller, Price executes Al-Asad and reveals that the caller was the leader of the ultranationalists: Imran Zakhaev. Price informs his squad about his assassination mission against Zakhaev in Pripyat, Ukraine in 1996. In the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Zakhaev took advantage of the turmoil to profit from nuclear proliferation and used his new wealth to lure soldiers from the Soviet Army to form his ultranationalist party. Price, then a lieutenant, and his superior, Captain MacMillan, were sent on a black operation to eliminate him. Making their way through Pripyat and into Chernobyl, the two reached their vantage point in an abandoned hotel, with Price firing upon Zakhaev with a Barrett M82 sniper rifle; however, the shot only severed Zakhaev's arm. Price and MacMillan barely escaped Zakhaev's henchmen.</p>

<p>Following the death of Al-Asad, Price's team hold off against Ultranationalist forces who arrive to avenge him. Later, a joint task force, composed of the SAS, Force Recon, and the loyalists, attempt to capture Zakhaev's son, Victor, to learn Zakhaev's whereabouts. After ambushing him in an enemy convoy at a vehicle checkpoint, Victor flees the scene but is soon cornered on the roof of an apartment building. Refusing to surrender, he commits suicide. Enraged, Zakhaev retaliates by taking control of a nuclear launch facility.</p>

<p>An operation is launched by the task force to take back the site from Zakhaev's forces via halo jump. However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and remotely destroy the missiles over the Atlantic Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>An ultranationalist Mi-24 Hind helicopter destroys a vital bridge and traps the joint force. In the ensuing fight, a tanker explodes, and many of the group are either killed or injured. Zakhaev himself arrives and begins killing wounded soldiers when loyalists in a Mi-28 Havoc suddenly destroy his Mi-24 Hind and join the fray. Distracted, Zakhaev turns to the loyalist forces at which point Price gives Soap an M1911; the latter kills Zakhaev and his escort. Loyalist forces start tending to the wounded immediately.<p>

<p>In the epilogue, the missile incident and the ultranationalists' support of Al-Asad are covered up, thus causing the events of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.<p></h4>

<h2>Modern Warfare 2</h2>
<h4><p>Despite the efforts of the U.S. Marine Corps and British Special Air Service in the previous game, the ultranationalists seize control of the Russian Federation, making Imran Zakhaev a martyr and straining diplomatic relations with the United States. Shortly after this, an ultranationalist named Vladimir Makarov, Zakhaev's right-hand man, begins a campaign of revenge against the West, by committing acts of terrorism on European and International soil over the course of five years.</p>

<p>In 2016, Private First Class Joseph Allen participates in a military operation alongside United States Army Rangers stationed in Afghanistan, by assisting them in taking back a city from insurgents. Impressed by Allen's capabilities, General Shepherd recruits him into Task Force 141. While Allen prepares for an upcoming assignment, Captain John "Soap" MacTavish and Sergeant Gary "Roach" Sanderson infiltrate a Russian airbase in the Tian Shan mountains to retrieve an Attack Characterization System (ACS) module from a downed American satellite.</p>

<p>Allen is soon sent on an undercover mission for the CIA, joining Vladimir Makarov in a mass shooting at an airport in Moscow, Russia. Afterwards, Makarov kills Allen, aware of his true identity, and leaves his body behind to spark a war between Russia and the United States. Outraged by an apparent American-sponsored terrorist attack, Russia retaliates by launching a surprise invasion on the East Coast of the United States.With no evidence of Makarov's involvement in the airport massacre, Task Force 141 is sent to Rio de Janeiro to capture his arms dealer, Alejandro Rojas. They succeed and learn that Makarov's nemesis is being held in a Russian gulag. They assault the gulag and rescue the prisoner: Captain Price, Soap's previous commanding officer in the SAS.</p>

<p>Price agrees to help Task Force 141 but insists on ending the United States' war with Russia. After raiding a Russian port, Price launches a ballistic missile towards Washington, D.C. and detonates it in the upper atmosphere. The resulting EMP blast disables all electronic devices across the Eastern Seaboard, giving the Americans a much-needed advantage.[c][27] Soldiers fighting in D.C. narrowly avoid a bombing run of Russian-occupied strategic structures by the United States Air Force, lighting green flares atop the White House to show that the city remains in American hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Task Force 141 narrows Makarov's hiding place to two locations; an aircraft boneyard in Afghanistan, and Makarov's safehouse on the Georgian-Russian border. Roach and Simon "Ghost" Riley successfully raid the safehouse, but are then betrayed and murdered by General Shepherd. It soon becomes evident that Shepherd is the catalyst of the Russian-U.S. war, intent on cementing his status as a national hero and prolonging military action as revenge for the men he lost to the nuclear device five years earlier, during the campaign against Khaled Al-Asad.</p>

<p>Price and Soap learn of Shepherd's betrayal and escape a battle between his and Makarov's forces at the boneyard. After learning of Shepherd's mountain base in Afghanistan from Makarov, Price and Soap raid the base to take revenge on Shepherd in a suicide mission. The duo pursue Shepherd's boat, and Price manages to shoot down his helicopter extraction as he and Soap tumble over a waterfall.[26] A dazed Soap stumbles towards the crash site and attempts to kill Shepherd, but is overpowered and stabbed in the chest. While Price arrives and engages Shepherd in a fist fight, Soap pulls the knife out of his chest and throws it at Shepherd, killing him. Nikolai arrives and helps Price evacuate Soap for medical attention.</p></h4>

<h2>Modern Warfare 3</h2>
<h4><p>Hours after killing General Shepherd, Price and Nikolai take a critically wounded Soap to a Russian loyalist safe-house in Himachal Pradesh for treatment. When Makarov sends troops to eliminate them, the group evacuate with the help of Yuri, an associate of Nikolai with a common grudge against Makarov. Meanwhile, an American four-man Delta Force team call-signed Metal aids in repelling Russian forces in New York City, destroying a Russian spectrum jamming tower on top of the Wall Street Stock Exchange, and hijacking an Oscar II-class submarine to eliminate the Russian Navy in the New York Bay. As a direct result, Russia withdraws its forces from the East Coast.</p>

<p>Two months later, Makarov and his operatives hijack a plane en route to Hamburg, containing the President of Russia, Boris Vorshevsky, to derail his planned peace treaty with the United States. After killing several members of the FSO, Makarov reveals to the Russian President that he intends to have Russia dominate Europe by using its nuclear arsenal. Vorshevsky refuses to give over the launch codes, so Makarov orders a search for his daughter, Alena, to break him. Subsequently, he orders for chemical bombs to be transported from Sierra Leone into every NATO-affiliated country's major cities, in order to cripple their intelligence networks and military bases. Despite the efforts of a SAS team to prevent the detonation in London, the attack proves successful, allowing Russian forces to invade most of Europe.</p>

<p>In response, the U.S. sends in counter-attack forces to assist in repelling the invasion, including a rescue operation led by Team Metal to rescue the Vice President of the United States in Hamburg after he was captured en route to the peace conference with Vorshevsky. During the chaos, Price's team gets a lead from his former commanding officer, MacMillan, that allows him to identify the bomb maker as Volk, the CEO of Fregata Industries. After killing Volk's Somali contact Waraabe, Price contacts Team Metal for help; the Delta Force team capture Volk in Paris with the help of the GIGN and other U.S. forces. After interrogating Volk, Metal informs Price of a meeting that Makarov intends to hold within Prague. Aided by loyalist Russian forces and Czech partisans, Price's team attempt to assassinate Makarov, only to learn that he anticipated this and arranged a trap for them. Despite managing to escape the trap and Makarov's men, Soap is mortally wounded during the chaos, and dies shortly after revealing to Price that Makarov knew Yuri.</p>

<p>An enraged Price holds Yuri at gunpoint and interrogates him over Soap's allegation, to which Yuri confirms that he was a former ally of Makarov â Yuri originally believed in both his and Imran Zakhaev's goals, helping to evacuate both in Pripyat after Price's assassination mission, but was disenchanted by the pair's use of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. When Yuri attempted to defect and warn the authorities of Makarov's plans, Makarov critically shot him before the airport massacre in Moscow and left him for dead, leaving him to be rescued by airport security. Price grudgingly maintains their alliance, and with assistance from MacMillan, infiltrate's Makarov's castle base near Prague for intel on Makarov's location.</p>

<p>Learning that Alena has been discovered to be hiding in Berlin, Price passes on the information to Team Metal. Though they fail to rescue Alena, the Vorshevskys are eventually tracked to a Siberian diamond mine, leading to Metal, Yuri and Price, forming a joint task force to rescue them. Although the group are successful, Metal sacrifice themselves to ensure the safe extraction of Yuri, Price and the Vorshevskys, as the mine begins to collapse. In the aftermath, Russia and the United States call a ceasefire, leading to the withdrawal of Russian forces from Europe as the two nations focus on peace talks. Meanwhile, Price and Yuri track down Makarov to a hotel in the Arabian Peninsula. With Nikolai's help, the pair manage to overcome his remaining forces with heavy equipment, while preventing him from leaving by helicopter. As Makarov gains the upper hand during the struggle, Yuri intervenes and is killed by Makarov, but his distraction allows Price to strangle and hang Makarov with a steel cable. As the police approach the hotel, a victorious Price smokes a cigar.</p></h4>
