	<h1><u>Modern Warfare</u></h1>


	<h3>With the release of the newest edition to the Modern Warfare Franchise, I decided that I should talk about the series that introduced me to the world of gaming. I first started playng the series on my Xbox 360, but the first game in the series I ever played was MW3, which is propably the most depressing out of them all. The series is argueably one of the greatest games in history and should be easily recognizable by everyone. so I decided to go deeper into the story and see if it has another moral to the story of topic other that terrorism and betrayal.</h3>
