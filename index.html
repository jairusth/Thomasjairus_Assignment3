	<h3>With the release of the newest edition to the Modern Warfare Franchise, I decided that I should make a video about the series that introduced me to the world of gaming. I first started playng the series on my Xbox 360, but the first game in the series I ever played was MW3, which is propably the most depressing out of them all. The series is argueably one of the greatest games in history and should be easily recognizable by everyone. This video pretty much visits all of the modern warfare games and shows you not just how far we have come, but also how far the characters (specifically Captain John Price) have come, from being pretty much a nobody in the S.A.S., to being the captain of the famous Task Force 141. If you do not know the storyline and/or the characters of the Modern Warfare Series, please go to pages 2 and three just to give you basic info.</h3>
